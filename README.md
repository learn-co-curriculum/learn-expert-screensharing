# Screensharing

We do a lot of screen sharing on one on one support shifts because we believe it is one of the best ways to help students. Working with students on a screen share means that we generally have to solve the problem using our normal debugging flow live and that is exactly the kind of information we want to impart to our students!

### How to Screen Share with Zoom

Open up Zoom on your computer (login) and start a meeting with 'Start without video' option. Once the meeting starts, you can send the student the link to the meeting in AAQ.

Now you can ask them to share their screen with the big button at the bottom that says Share Screen. Once you see their screen, you can request access to gain control by using the menu at the top of the screen share. 

Durring the course of the screen share, you may also find that you need to take control of their computer to run some commands (especially if it's a [workflow](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/common-learn-questions.md#1-learnideworkflow-issues) issue or if you want to show them how to use a tool). Zoom allows this, all you'll have to do is open a drop down menu from the screen share on your end and request remote control access from the student.

>Note: You may not be able to access this menu until you enter full screen mode. Once the remote control is initiated though, you should be able to exit full screen mode if you like. 
The easiest way to initiate a screen share is by creating a meeting (_without_ web cam) using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download). You can then simply send the student the link in the chat :)

### Screen Share Best Practices

You'll want to make sure that you are in a relativley quiet area so it's easy for the student to hear you.

Keep screen shares to 15 to 20min max (especially if there are other students waiting in the screen share queue). You can let the student know that you'll line them up for more help if they're not done or that they can resolve this chat and open a new one if they need help later on and leave them with resources to keep going. 

Try and keep screen share sessions from turning into pair programing. Once you helped the student with the test/error they were stuck on, see if you can get them to move on, on their own. We're here to help students get unstuck on tests that they have already been working on, not just pair on tests with them.
